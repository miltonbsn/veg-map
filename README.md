# Vegetarian Restaurants in Florianópolis - Brazil / Neighborhood Map (React)

This is my final project of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree by Udacity. It is mobile and offline first!

## Purpose

The app functionality is to locate vegetarian restaurants in Florianópolis, Brazil. You can filter the restaurants by a cousine type. If you click on a card or in a map marker, details should be displayed.

## How to install

To install you first need to download by **git clone** or download button. Afterwards you should use **npm i** or **npm install** and then **npm start** to start the project.
